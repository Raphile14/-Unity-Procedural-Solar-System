# Unity-Procedural-Solar-System
A Final Project for CS124: Algorithms And Complexity

## Goals
### Primary Goals:
* Seeded generation in order to recreate the same output
* Unique Surface (mountain ranges, and etc)
* Day and Night Cycle
* Temperature Based on Daylight
* Procedurally Textured Planets

### Other Goals (if I have additional time):
* Explorable Solar System
* Multiple Planets
* Natural Satellites such as Moons
* Planets with their own orbits and rotations

### Very Hard Goals (I want to dream):
* Flora and Fauna
* Cave System
* Atmosphere
* Gravity and Mass
* Water and Cloud (Rain) Mechanics

## Credits
* Planet Generation Algorithm heavily based on [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague)'s [Procedural Planets](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Planets)
